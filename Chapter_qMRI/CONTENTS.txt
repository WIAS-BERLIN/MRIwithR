 This folder contains extracted code from the chapters of the second edition of the book.
 Files chapter_xxx.R provide the complete code of chapter xxx while
 init_xxx.R contains the package initializations and filename declarations and
 chapter_xxx_code(n).R are code snippets that can be run independently from each other after sourcing 'init_xxx' and
 a) intermediate results have been downloaded as described in Appendix C or
 b) all code snippets with smaller number have been run at lest once before to generate the intermediate results needed.
